There are a few rules one should follow when designing new maps. These rules are listed below in no particular oder.

You should ALWAYS:

- Give the length and breadth of the map on the first line of your text file.
- Always make passages at least 5 spaces wide, remember that vertical passages will look smaller than horizontal ones
  in the text editor.
- Place atmospheric sounds strategically to guide the player between rooms and passages.
- Place atmospheric sounds in font of doorways.
- Make sure that there is always some atmospheric sound to be heard, wherever the player is.
- Place a proportionate ammount of ammo and health pickups to the number of enemies throughout the level.
- Make your levels fairly straight-forward to navigate, don't confuse the player.
- place keys on the map that the player must find to move between areas.
- Place new floor surfaces just outside of doorways when changing surfaces.
- Have a middle character in your doors.
- Have a clear finishing point.
- Bear in mind that sounds can still be heard through walls.

You should NEVER:

- Place more than one enemy in a single room.
- Place many atmospheric sounds in close proximity to one another.
- Re-use atmospheric sounds in areas that are too close to one another.
- Place enemies right behind doorways.

HAVE FUN!
